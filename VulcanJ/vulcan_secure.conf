# TRAND (SAS Transactional Driver) configuration file
#
# Comments
# --------
# The # character is used for comments and can be placed anywhere on a
# line.  Anything following the # character on a line is considered a
# comment.
#
# Examples:
#
#    # This is a comment
#    DefaultDbCachePages = 2048   # This is an end-of-line comment
#
# Entries
# -------
# The default value for each entry is listed to the right of the "=".
# To activate an entry, remove the leading "#"s and supply the desired
# value.
#
# Please note, a number of the values are specified in **Bytes** (Not KB).
# Accordingly, we have provided some simple conversion tables at the bottom
# of this file.
#
# There are three types of configuration values: integer, boolean and string.
# 
# Integer
# --------
# An Integer is just what it sounds like, an integral value. Examples:
#   1
#   42
#   4711
# 
# Boolean
# -------
# Boolean is expressed as integer values with 0 (zero) being "false" and
# non-zero is taken to mean "true". For consistency we recommend you
# only use 0/1.
# 
# String
# ------
# Strings are also what they sound like, strings. Examples:
#   RootDirectory  = /opt/trand
#   RemotePipeName = pipe47

# ----------------------------
# External File Paths/Directories
#
# ExternalFileAccess may be None, Full or Restrict. If you choose 
# Restrict, provide ';'-separated trees list, where external files 
# are stored. Relative paths are treated relative to RootDirectory entry
# (see above). Default value 'None' disables any use of external files
# on your site. To specify access to specific trees, enum all required
# paths (for Win32 this may be something like 'C:\ExternalTables', 
# for unix - '/db/extern;/mnt/extern').
#
# NOTE: THE EXTERNAL TABLE ENGINE FEATURE COULD BE USED TO COMPROMISE
# THE SERVER/HOST AS WELL AS DATABASE SECURITY!!
#
# IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT THIS SETTING BE USED TO LIMIT
# EXTERNAL TABLE LOCATIONS!
#
# Type: string (special format)
#
#ExternalFileAccess = Full

# ----------------------------
# Temporary directories
#
# Provide ';'-separated trees list, where temporary files are stored.
# Relative paths are treated relative to RootDirectory entry
# (see above). Default value is determined using
# TEMP or TMP environment options. Every directory item may have optional
# size argument to limit its storage, this argument follows the directory
# name and must be separated by at least one space character. If the size
# argument is omitted or invalid, then all available space in this
# directory will be used.
#
# E.g.:
# TempDirectories = c:\temp
# or
# TempDirectories = c:\temp;d:\temp
# or
# TempDirectories = c:\temp 100000000;d:\temp 500000000;e:\temp
#
# Type: string (special format)
#
#TempDirectories =

# ----------------------------
# Number of cached database pages
#
# This sets the number of pages from any one database that can be held
# in cache at once. If you increase this value, the engine will
# allocate more pages to the cache for every database. By default
# TKTS / SAS Table Server allocates 75 pages per client connection.
#
# NOTE: CHANGING THIS SETTING IN A MULTI-USER ENVIRONMENT CAN REALLY
# EAT MEMORY. 
# 
# TOTAL CACHING MEMORY = (# CACHED PAGES) * (PAGE SIZE OF DATABASE) *
#    (# OF CONNECTIONS).
#
# Type: integer
#
#DefaultDbCachePages = 75


# ----------------------------
# In-memory sorting module
#
# The amount of memory allocated for each sort block.
#
# Type: integer
#
#SortMemBlockSize = 1048576

#
# The maximum amount of memory to be allocated by the in-memory
# sorting module.
#
# For TKTS/SAS Table Server, this setting is defaulted to 8 MB.
# Although it can be increased, the value applies to each client
# connection/server instance and thus consumes a lot of memory.
#
# Type: integer
#
#SortMemUpperLimit = 67108864


# ----------------------------
# Boolean evaluation method (complete or shortcut)
#
# If your SQL code depends on side-effects of full evaluation of OR
# and AND statements (right-hand-side terms), even if the expressions
# final result could be determined by just examining the value of the
# first term, you might need to turn this on.
#
# Type: boolean
#
#CompleteBooleanEvaluation = 0


# ----------------------------
# 
# Determines the number of seconds that the lock manager will wait after a
# conflict has been encountered before purging locks from dead processes 
# and doing extra deadlock scan cycle. Engine detects deadlocks instantly 
# in all normal cases, so this value affects things only if something goes
# wrong. Setting it too low may degrade system performance. 
#
# Type: integer
#
#DeadlockTimeout = 10


# ----------------------------
#
# How often the pages are flushed on disk
# (for databases with ForcedWrites=Off only)
#
# Number of unflushed writes which will accumulate before they are
# flushed, at the next transaction commit.  For non-Win32 ports,
# the default value is -1 (Disabled)
#
# Type: integer
#
#MaxUnflushedWrites = 100

#
# Number of seconds during which unflushed writes will accumulate
# before they are flushed, at the next transaction commit. For non-Win32
# ports, the default value is -1 (Disabled)
#
# Type: integer
#
#MaxUnflushedWriteTime = 5


# ----------------------------
#
# This option controls whether to call abort() when internal error or BUGCHECK
# is encountered thus invoke post-mortem debugger which can dump core suitable 
# for off-line analysis. When disabled engine tries to minimize damage and 
# continue execution. 
#
# Note that setting this option to 1 makes engine produce traceable coredumps 
# when something nasty like SIGSEGV happens inside UDF. On Windows enabling 
# this option makes engine invoke JIT debugger facilities when errors happen.
#
# Type: boolean
#
#BugcheckAbort = 0


# ----------------------------
# Locking and shared memory parameters
#
# Bytes of shared memory allocated for lock manager. This is the size of the
# lock (.lck) file and the size of lock file extensions (.ext). The table
# expands dynamically up to the limit of memory.
#
# Default is 256K.
#
# Type: integer
#
#LockMemSize = 262144

#
# Only one client process may access the lock table at any
# time. Access to the lock table is governed by a mutex. The mutex can
# be requested conditionally - a wait is a failure and the request must
# be retried - or unconditionally - the request will wait until it is
# satisfied. This parameter establishes the number of attempts that
# will be made conditionally. Zero value means unconditional mode.
# Relevant only on SMP machines.
#
# Type: integer
#
#LockAcquireSpins = 0

#
# Tune lock hash list; more hash slots mean shorter hash chains. Only
# necessary under very high load. Prime number values are recommended.
#
# Type: integer
#
#LockHashSlots = 101

# ----------------------------
#
# Bytes of shared memory allocated for event manager.
#
# Type: integer

#
# TRAND debugging options must be included in the "database" section.
# Options can be combined, and separated by commas. Debugging options are
# only useful for technical support and shouldn't be modified by end users.
# Additional logging will slow down the server.
#
# Here are the various options:
# 
#   MaxRecursion=n                 Max depth of recursion allowed in PASS1
#   RecursionFrameSize=n           Size in bytes of each call frame in PASS1
#   TraceDSQL=1                    Trace DSQL parsing recursion
#   AbortCount=n                   Count of times before triggering abort check
#   AbortDebug=n                   Coded value describing abort check behavior
#   StatusVector=A|B|X             Dump status vector after, before, or both
#   MessageParse=1                 Dump SQLDA message vectors
#   DisassembleBLR=USER|SYSTEM     Disassemble BLR for user or system requests
#   DebugFile="name"               Name of debug file, sas_debug.log is default
#   DebugDBPassword=1              Debug table coupling.
